(1)     Read manual.pdf if you can.

(2)     Edit conf/setup.conf and set SUNFLOWERROOT, and HOST
	appropriately.  You might need to set your $OSTYPE environment
	variable in your shell if it is not already set.  Examples
	include "darwin" for MacOSX, and the eponymous "OpenBSD",
	"linux", "solaris".

(3)     cd to sim/ and type 'make'. The build should work automatically
	on MacOS, Linux, and Solaris.  This builds the console
	version of the simulator.

(4)     To build the cross-compiler, first populate tools/source
	with the appropriate distributions (there are currently
	empty place-holder directories therein). You should be able
	to obtain these distributions from:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.1.1/gcc-4.1.1.tar.bz2
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.16.1.tar.bz2
	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/newlib/newlib-1.9.0.tar.gz

	Download the above into tools/source.  You can delete or
	overwrite the existing empty stub directories.

	Next, type 'make cross' from the root of the installation
	(the directory containing this README file).  That will
	start the process of configuring the aforementioned
	distributions to build the cross-compiler suite for the
	simulator.

	NOTE: On Mac OS 10.5 and later, 'make cross CFLAGS=-Os'
	will prevent the build of the cross-compiler from generating
	.dylib debugging symbol files, which currently causes many
	problems with autoconf related tools.
