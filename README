(1)	Read manual.pdf if you can.

(2)	Edit conf/setup.conf and set SUNFLOWERROOT, and HOST appropriately.
	You might need to set your $OSTYPE environment variable in your shell
	if it is not already set.  Examples include "darwin" for MacOSX,
	and the eponymous "OpenBSD", "linux", "solaris".

(3)	cd to sim/ and type 'make'. The build should work automatically on
	MacOS, Linux, and Solaris.  This builds the console version of
	the simulator.

(4)	To build the cross-compiler, first populate tools/source with the
	appropriate distributions (there are currently empty placeholder
	directories therein). You should be able to obtain these distributions
	from:

	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/gcc/gcc-4.1.1.tar.gz
	ftp://ftp.gnu.org/pub/gnu/binutils/binutils-2.16.1.tar.gz
	ftp://sources.redhat.com/pub/newlib/newlib-1.9.0.tar.gz
	
	Download the above into tools/source.  You can delete or
	overwrite the existing empty stub directories.
	
	Next, type 'make cross' from the root of
	the installation (the directory containing this README file).
	That will start the process of configuring the aforementioned
	distirbutions to build the cross-compiler suite for the simulator.
